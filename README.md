Description
The dataset contains detailed information about different cars including manufacturer, model, year, engine size, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and selling price. It is useful for analyzing sales trends, comparing car brands, and identifying the impact of various features (like engine size and fuel type) on prices.

Visualizations

Line Plot: Shows the trend of average car prices across different years of manufacture, helping us understand how newer cars tend to retain higher prices compared to older ones.

The bar chart compares the average prices of cars across different manufacturers. Luxury brands such as Porsche have significantly higher average prices, while Ford and Volkswagen (VW) remain more affordable. This helps in identifying how brand reputation and market positioning influence car prices.

Line Plot: The line plot shows the trend of average car prices across manufacturing years. It highlights that newer cars generally retain higher values, while older models depreciate in price over time.

Point Plot: The point plot compares the average car prices across different fuel types or manufacturers with confidence intervals. It clearly shows how certain categories consistently stand above others in terms of pricing.

KDE Plot: The KDE plot displays the density distribution of car prices, showing where most prices are concentrated. It helps identify whether the price distribution is skewed, spread out, or centered around certain ranges.

#Insights

Fuel Types: Petrol cars are the most common, but hybrids and luxury vehicles command the highest prices. Diesel vehicles, although popular, are generally cheaper.

Manufacturers: Porsche consistently has the highest average prices, while Ford and VW cater to the affordable market segment. Toyota provides a balance between price and reliability.

Mileage Impact: A clear negative correlation exists—cars with higher mileage lose value rapidly. Low-mileage cars are valued more in the resale market.

Year of Manufacture: Newer cars (recent years) are priced significantly higher, while older models drop in value, except for rare or luxury editions that remain expensive.

Engine Size: Larger engines (2.0L and above) are associated with higher selling prices, indicating the premium value of performance vehicles.

Data Spread: Box and violin plots reveal the wide variation in prices, with some extreme outliers representing luxury or high-performance models.

Market Insights: Buyers looking for budget cars should explore high-mileage diesel options, while sellers of low-mileage hybrids or large-engine petrol cars can expect premium prices.
